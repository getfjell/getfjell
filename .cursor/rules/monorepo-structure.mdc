# Monorepo Structure

## Overview

This is a monorepo with multiple interconnected projects. Projects are linked locally, not through npm registry. Each project has its own package.json but they share dependencies through local linking.

## Main Projects

- **api** - Main API server
- **lib** - Shared library code
- **core** - Core utilities
- **providers** - Provider implementations
- **cache** - Caching layer
- **client-api** - Client API layer

## Project Dependencies

Projects depend on each other through local linking. When you make changes to a shared library (like `lib` or `core`), dependent projects automatically pick up those changes through the local link.

## Key Principles

- Projects are locally linked, not published to npm
- Each project has its own build and test pipeline
- Changes to shared libraries affect all dependent projects
- Always test downstream effects of library changes
